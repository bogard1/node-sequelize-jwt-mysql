### Description

Before you logged in, check which organization does that user belongs to
once the organization is retrieved , then license is queried if this organization has valid license if not the it will be prompt to subscribe.

By not making license as fk in organization we are keeping user hassles away from entering license admin logged in create an organization license is automatically created for that organization with its status false.Once organization is created , suppose if he pay license start and end date. Or when user is created they will be asked to add organization.
